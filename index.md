### **About Me**


I am currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/) at the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). Previously, I was a ML scientist at AWS AI Labs. Before that, I was a Neyman Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was very fortunate to be supervised by [Bin Yu](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/Site/Welcome.html). Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley's [Foundations of Data Analysis (FODA) Institute](https://foda.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Statistics at the [University of Chicago](http://galton.uchicago.edu/) where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Rina Foygel Barber](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~rina/). My PhD research was supported by [Kwanjeong Fellowship](http://en.ikef.or.kr/).


My research is centered on high-dimensional statistics and machine learning, with a focus on sparse and low rank optimization, local graph clustering, and interpretable machine learning, and domain adaptation under distribution shifts. I am also interested in the applications of statistical and optimization methods to diverse scientific areas such as medical imaging, population genetics, and cosmology.
