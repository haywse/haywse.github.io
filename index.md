### **_About Me_**


I am currently a fifth year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. 
I am very happy to be advised by Rina Foygel Barber. My research is supported by Kwanjeong Fellowship.


My current research is centered on high-dimensional statistics and (non)convex optimization. 
I also work on calibration and image reconstruction for medical imaging. I also look forward to exploring research in other areas of statistics and machine learning!
