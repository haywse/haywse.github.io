### **About Me**


I am currently a Neyman Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) hosted by [Bin Yu](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~binyu/Site/Welcome.html). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley's [Foundations of Data Analysis (FODA) Institute](https://foda.berkeley.edu/) and also a fellow at [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). Prior to that, I did my PhD in Statistics at the [University of Chicago](http://galton.uchicago.edu/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Rina Foygel Barber](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~rina/). My PhD research was supported by [Kwanjeong Fellowship](http://en.ikef.or.kr/).


My current research is centered on high-dimensional statistics and optimization, with a focus on sparse and low rank optimization, local graph clustering, interpretable machine learning, and domain adaptation. I am particularly interested in applications of statistical and optimization methods to diverse scientific areas such as medical imaging, population genetics, and cosmology. I also look forward to exploring research in other areas of statistics and machine learning!
