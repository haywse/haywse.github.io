### **About Me**


I am currently a fifth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](http://galton.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).
I am very happy to be advised by [Rina Foygel Barber](http://galton.uchicago.edu/~rina/). My research is supported by [Kwanjeong Fellowship](http://en.ikef.or.kr/).


My current research is centered on high-dimensional statistics and (non)convex optimization.
I also work on calibration and image reconstruction for medical imaging. I also look forward to exploring research in other areas of statistics and machine learning!
